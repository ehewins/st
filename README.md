# My build of st

My own build of [st](https://st.suckless.org/), with the patches I use and a few features brought over from [Luke Smith's build](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st).

## Requirements

Obviously you'll need the correct nerd font (see config.h), I've been using the v2.0 release since later versions have caused me problems with polybar before. For my backup font I'm using Noto Color Emoji, so grab that too. For emojis and some other unicode characters to work in st, you'll need [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra) from the AUR.
You'll also need `libX11`, `libXft` as well as `make`, but any normal linux user will already have these installed.

## Installation

Just clone and make:

```
git clone https://github.com/fillthisinlater
cd st
sudo make clean install
```

## Features

The rest of this readme I'll fill in later
